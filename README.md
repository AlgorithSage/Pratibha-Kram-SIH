Introducing KHEL-BID: The Ultimate Sports Talent Marketplace
KHEL-BID is a revolutionary mobile platform designed to connect aspiring athletes directly with scouts, clubs, and recruiters. It's a comprehensive ecosystem where you can showcase your talent, prove your skills with cutting-edge AI, and get hired through a unique bidding marketplace.

Key Features:

Dynamic Athlete Profile & Reel Sharing:

Create a professional sports profile and upload highlight videos and reels of your gameplay, just like on a social media platform. Gain visibility and let your talent shine for a global audience of recruiters, fans, and fellow players.

AI-Powered Performance Verification:

Go beyond simple videos. Our app uses Google MediaPipe to analyze your performance in standardized fitness and sport-specific drills. Get instant, unbiased feedback on metrics like jump height, speed, agility, and rep counts, with built-in AI cheat detection to ensure fair and authentic assessments.

The Bidding & Recruitment Marketplace:

Get Noticed: Recruiters scout talent by watching reels and reviewing profiles.

Bidding Begins: Interested recruiters place bids to win an exclusive chance to formally assess you.

AI-Screening: The winning recruiter assigns specific tests. You perform them on the app, and our AI verifies your results, serving as an official initial screening.

The Final Trial: If you pass the AI screening, you'll be invited for an in-person trial, leading to a professional contract.

AI-Powered Community Safety:

Just like major social networks, our platform uses an advanced AI model to automatically detect and flag any video content that breaches community guidelines, ensuring a safe, positive, and professional environment for all users.

Our Business Model:

We succeed when you succeed. KHEL-BID operates on a fair, performance-based model. We take a small 1-2% commission from an athlete's salary only after they have been successfully discovered and signed to a professional contract through our platform.
